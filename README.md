### Making Changes

Local dev is borked becasue the ecosystem has moved on from this stack. For significant changes, a rewrite will be required. For minor changes, push a new branch up and use Netlify's preview deploys which are set up to trigger on every branch in the repo. Merging into master deploys to production.
